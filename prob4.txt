3 way which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML:

=> Text Content
=> Page Layout
=> Alt attribute

=> Text Content:
------------------
✔ A well structured content having headings, paragraphs, and lists is helpful in accessibility for users who rely on screen readers
✔ The screen reaer reads each header out as you progress through the content, notifying oyou what a heading is and what a paragraph is.


=> Page Layout:
------------------
✔ Although it is possible to design a layou using nested <div> element, but it is preferable to use proper sectioning elements to encapsulate your main navigation (<nav>), footer (<footer>),(<article>) encapsulate
✔ These elements offers additional semantic to screen reader and other assitive tools, provide users with more context and informaion about the content they are browsing.

=> Alt attribute:
-------------------
✔ Alt arrtibute and title attribute helps in hte accessibility, whre alt attribute provides alternative text for an image if the image
 can not be displayed or user is using screen reader to access the page.

 ex: <img src="icon.png" alt="icon image">
